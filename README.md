# 👋🇧🇷 Hi there! 

I’m a **Software Engineering** student currently exploring technologies like **TypeScript, Angular,** and various tools and frameworks with a focus on Front-end development to enhance my skills.

🔧 On the front-end, I’m diving into Angular development and aiming to create elegant and functional interfaces.

🏐 When I’m not coding, I love playing volleyball, watching movies, and solving Rubik’s cubes!
